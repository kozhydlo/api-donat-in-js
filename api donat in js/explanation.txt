Sure, here's an example of a simple JavaScript API for accepting donations on a website using the Stripe payment platform:

First, you'll need to create a Stripe account and obtain your API keys. Then, you can use the following code as a starting point:



This code assumes that you have a donation form on your website with an input field named "amount" that collects the donation amount from the user. When the user submits the form, the code creates a Stripe Checkout session with the specified donation amount, and then redirects the user to the Stripe Checkout page to complete the payment.

On your server, you'll also need to implement the /create-checkout-session endpoint to create a Stripe Checkout session with the specified donation amount. Here's an example implementation using the Stripe Node.js library:



This code creates a Stripe Checkout session with the specified donation amount, and then returns the session ID to the client so that they can be redirected to the Stripe Checkout page.

Note that this is just a starting point, and you may need to modify the code to fit your specific requirements. For example, you may want to add additional fields to the donation form, or customize the Stripe Checkout page with your own branding. Additionally, you should make sure to follow best practices for handling payments securely and complying with relevant regulations.
